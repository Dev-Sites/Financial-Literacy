     <h2>Answers:</h2>
     <h2 class="header_idea">Tax file number</h2>
     <p><strong>If you answered yes you are incorrect<br />
 </strong>If prior to commencing business Julie had an individual tax file number, she will not need to register for another. As a sole trader she is able to use her individual tax file number.</p>
     <p>If her business structure was a partnership, trust or company, then she would need to register a separate tax file number.</p>
     <p>If she does not have an individual tax file number, then she will need to make application to the Australian tax office.</p>
     <p><strong>If you answered no you are correct<br />
 </strong>Correct. Providing Julie has an individual tax file number, there is no need for her to apply for another. A sole trader is able to use their individual tax file number.</p>
     <p>&nbsp;</p>
     
     <h2 class="header_idea">ABN</h2>
     <p><strong>If you answered yes you are incorrect</strong><strong><br />
 </strong>If Julie does not register for GST then she does not have to have an ABN.</p>
     <p>She can choose to have an ABN which will make it easier for other tax registrations (e.g. PAYG withholding) as well as avoiding other businesses withholding 46.5% of any payments they make to her. It is a requirement of a business to withhold 46.5% of any payment they make unless they are quoted an ABN.</p>
     <p>&nbsp;</p>
     <p><strong>If you answered no you are correct</strong><strong><br />
 </strong>Correct, if Julie does not register for GST then she does not have to have an ABN.</p>
     <p>But she can choose to have an ABN. This will make it easier for other tax registrations (e.g. PAYG withholding) as well as avoiding other businesses withholding 46.5% of any payments they make to her. It is a requirement of a business to withhold 46.5% of any payment they make unless they are quoted an ABN.</p>
     <p>&nbsp;</p>
     <h2 class="header_idea">GST</h2>
     <p><strong>If you answered yes you are incorrect</strong><strong><br />
 </strong>Because Julie's expected turnover is less than $75,000 she does not have to register for GST. If this situation changes and she realises her turnover will exceed $75,000 then she has 21 days from this point to register for GST.</p>
     <p>Although with an expected turnover of less than $75,000 Julie can, if she wishes, register for GST. By doing so she will have to charge GST and claim GST credits.</p>
     <p>&nbsp;</p>
     <p><strong>If you answered no you are correct</strong><strong><br />
 </strong>Correct, as Julie's expected turnover is less than $75,000 she does not have to register for GST. </p>
     <p>Should the situation change and the expectation of turnover rise to in excess of $75,000 she will then have 21 days in which to register.</p>
     <p>Although with an expected turnover of less than $75,000 Julie can, if she wishes, register for GST. By doing so she will have to charge GST and claim GST credits.</p>
     <p>&nbsp;</p>
     <h2 class="header_idea">PAYG withholding</h2>
     <p><strong>If you answered yes you are incorrect<br />
 </strong>As Julie has no employees she will not have to register for PAYG withholding.</p>
     <p>&nbsp;</p>
     <p><strong>If you answered no you are correct</strong><strong><br />
 </strong>Correct, Julie has no employees so does not need to register for PAYG withholding.</p>
     <p>&nbsp;</p>
     <h2 class="header_idea">Fringe benefits tax</h2>
     <p><strong>If you answered yes you are incorrect</strong><strong><br />
 </strong>Julie has no need to register for fringe benefits tax as she has no employees.</p>
     <p>Fringe benefits are benefits paid to employees, such as club membership fees, or a work vehicle.</p>
     <p>&nbsp;</p>
     <p><strong>If you answered no you are correct</strong><br />
 Correct. Julie has no need to register for fringe benefits tax as she has no employees.</p>
     <p>Fringe benefits are benefits paid to employees, such as club membership fees, or a work vehicle. </p>
     <h2>Summary</h2><p>In Julie's situation there are a number of tax registrations that she can choose to register the business for (i.e. they are not compulsory). These choices are influenced by how she wishes to operate the business.</p>

<p>Julie chooses the following tax registrations</p>
<p><img src="../images/03_cross.jpg" alt="cross" /> &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>TFN</strong> - As a sole trader Julie can use her existing
 individual TFN.</p>
    <p><img src="../images/03_tick.jpg" alt="cross" /> &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>ABN</strong> - Although not compulsory, as Julie wishes to
 register for GST she will need a ABN.</p>
    <p><img src="../images/03_tick.jpg" alt="cross" /> &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>GST </strong>- Julie's expected turnover dictates she does
 not have to register for GST, but she has decided she prefers to charge GST and claim GST credits.</p>
    <p><img src="../images/03_cross.jpg" alt="cross" /> &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>PAYG withholding</strong> - This is not a requirement as
 Julie has no employees.</p>
    <p><img src="../images/03_cross.jpg" alt="cross" /> &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>Fringe benefits tax</strong> - This is not a requirement as 
 Julie has no employees.</p>
