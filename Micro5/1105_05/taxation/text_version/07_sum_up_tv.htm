     <h1>Sum up</h1>
     <p>Reflect on your understanding of each area.</p>
     <h2 class="header_idea">Acronyms and terminology</h2>
     <p><strong>Good </strong>= Great. If you are going to manage your own business taxation requirements you will need a good understanding of terms relevant to taxation. This is also true if you are intending to engage a tax advisor, in this situation you will still require knowledge of terminology to understand and share information with the advisor.</p>
      <p><strong>Unsure</strong> = To improve your knowledge about taxation acronyms and terminology, review both the<strong> Acronym</strong> and <strong>Terminology</strong> pages. There is more information in the <strong>Support </strong>section and you can source information from the Australian Taxation Office web site, www.ato.gov.au</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <h2 class="header_idea">Taxation registrations</h2>
     <p>
 <strong>Good</strong> = Good. It is a requirement that you complete the necessary taxation registrations for a business, and if the business changes you may need to change the registrations to suit.</p>
      <p><strong> Unsure</strong> = To improve your knowledge about taxation registrations, review the <strong>Registration</strong> page. There is more information in the <strong>Business Support</strong> section and you can source information from the Australian Taxation Office web site, www.ato.gov.au</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <h2 class="header_idea">Record keeping</h2>
     <p>
 <strong>Good</strong> = Fantastic. Keeping good records can obviously make meeting your tax requirements easier, but it also has other advantages, for example it can help you track the financial position of the business, recognise where problems exist and allow action to be taken.</p>
     <p> <strong>Unsure</strong> = To improve your knowledge about keeping records, review the <strong>Records</strong> page. There is more information in the <strong>Business Support</strong> section and you can source information from the Australian Taxation Office web site, www.ato.gov.au</p>
