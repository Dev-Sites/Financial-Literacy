<h1>Marketing</h1>
<p>You need potential customers to know who you are and what your business has to offer, so marketing your micro business is important. To convince new customers to use your business you need to find the right words.</p>
<ul>
  <li>How powerful is your message? </li>
</ul> <div class="clear">&nbsp;</div>
<p>This comes down to how well can you tell your story? How persuasive are you? Your success is determined by the degree of confidence that people have in you after being exposed to your advertising message. You must anticipate your customer's concerns and provide answers to all their questions <em>before</em> they ever have to ask them. </p>
<p>The key to writing effective advertising is by crafting compelling descriptions to make consumers think they can't live without the product being advertised. </p>
<p>Copywriters use a wealth of adjectives and descriptive phrases to personalize a product and give it meaning. Successful copywriting uses descriptors that appeal to consumers' five senses, effectively allowing consumers subconsciously to smell the product, touch it, taste it, see it and hear it as if they were actually using it at that moment. Read the following examples</p>
<ul>
      <li>Example one<strong><br />
      </strong>'You'll get beautiful flowers at  Blooms and More Florist'</li>
  <li>Example two<br />
    'Fill your home with the fresh aroma and vibrant colours of a floral arrangement  from Blooms and More Florist.'</li>
</ul> <div class="clear">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Which example would advertise your micro business more effectively?</p>
<p>There are many ways to advertise and you will need to consider using several to get your message out to your target audience. </p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Outdoor advertising/billboards:</strong> These reach more people for a dollar than any other media, but are  limited to a picture and no more than eight words. </li>
  <li><strong>Radio:</strong> Reaches the second  larget group of people for a dollar, but cannot be targeted geographically and can only be  loosely demographically targeted. But if people will drive significant  distances to buy your product, or if you're selling a 'we come to  you' service, this is a good option.</li>
  <li><strong>Broadcast television:</strong> Big prestige. Big dollars. But able to target psychographic profiles. Buy  advertising space for specific shows.</li>
  <li><strong>Newspapers:</strong> Reach customers  who are in the market to buy today. Unfortunately, people not currently in the  market for your product or service are less likely to notice your advertisement than if it  had appeared in another media. </li>
  <li><strong>Magazines:</strong> Expensive, but  high-impact with tight targeting. There is little waste. A weakness is the infrequency of  repetition. </li>
  <li><strong>Direct mail:</strong> Highly targeted, all the way down to the level of the individual. It is very expensive to do it well.</li>
  <li><strong>Yellow Pages:</strong> Essentially a service directory which can be used online or in book  form.</li>
</ul> <div class="clear">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Is your ad budget sufficient for the size of marketplace you're attempting to reach? There are no direct links between how much you spend and what you can expect to see in return for your advertising. However results increase with repetition<strong>.</strong> When you've identified a message that generates a positive response and you deliver that message consistently, business growth in year two can be approximately twice the growth of year one. </p>
<ul>
  <li>
    On a small scale you could organise flyers for a  letterbox drop. For this option use a lightly coloured paper with two colours  of ink. The second colour will make your business appear more 'real' to your  prospective customer.
  </li>
  <li>When using flyers have them designed by a professional for the best  customer response and be prepared to spend a few hundred dollars on graphic  design.</li>
</ul> <div class="clear">&nbsp;</div>
