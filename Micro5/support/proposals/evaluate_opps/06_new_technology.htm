<h1>New technology</h1>
<p>Selling products or services online is almost mandatory for all businesses today. </p>
<p>A website can allow a  business to capture new and untapped clients, as well as cater for existing clients. Some websites allow clients to browse catalogues, select products, and place them in a virtual shopping cart. The client can then proceed to the checkout and process the transaction for the contents of the cart through the e-commerce website payment gateway. The funds from the sale are deposited immediately and the order can be despatched immediately. </p>
<h2>Connecting with technology</h2>
<p>To get started you will need:</p>
<ul>
  <li>computer </li>
  <li>software that enables you to send emails, browse  the internet and protect your computer's safety </li>
  <li>email   address</li>
  <li>training in using your new computer and software.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Advice for setting up a  business website</h2>
<p>There are a number of steps involved with setting up a website. If you are technically adept you can design one yourself, however there are many businesses that can provide this service for you. Either way, you need to make some decisions about what will be on your website and how it will function.</p>
<p>Some general advice to follow for your  business website:</p>
<ul>
  <li>use a clean, uncluttered professional image</li>
  <li>start in a small modest way, at a small cost to  get presence on the internet</li>
  <li>include links to other sites on your website;  the more links you have, the more important your business appears.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps for creating a website</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Plan<br />
  </strong>Careful planning helps  maximise the benefits of your online business and reduces the risk of things  going wrong.&nbsp;</li>
  <li><strong>Choose an  ISP<br />
  </strong>Choose an internet service  provider (ISP) to set up your email account - many ISPs also provide website  hosting service and domain name registration services.</li>
  <li><strong>Select your  domain name<br />
  </strong>Your domain name is your  unique electronic address on the internet. You can arrange this yourself or  through an ISP.</li>
  <li><strong>Design and  build your website<br />
  </strong>The website should encourage  people to look at your products. Planning is important. Research other  websites and find out what your customers and suppliers would like to see.</li>
  <li><strong>Promote and  market your website<br />
  </strong>Let your current and potential customers know about your new website.&nbsp;Include your  website details on all your promotional material.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Eftpos and credit card facilities for your  business</h2>
<p>Paying by plastic dominates our buying habits today. As a result banking institutions offer businesses EFTPOS terminals that accept credit and debit card payments. </p>
<p>The EFTPOS facility is a small unit that connects via a telephone line to the issuing bank for authorisation. The transaction takes seconds and helps banks protect you and consumers against card fraud. EFTPOS machines also successfully support online businesses with little customer contact.</p>
<p>Contact your bank to find out more information about establishing eftpos facilities for your own  business.</p>
<h2>Telephones and plans</h2>
<p>Phones are still vital for business. Telephone service providers offer numerous telephones and plans, so make sure you explore all your options to find what is right for your  business. Many people choose a combination of landline and mobile phone technology for business. <br />
</p>
<p>Contact your telephone service provider to see what packaged deals they have to offer your  business. </p>
<h2>Emerging technology and other business</h2>
<p>Using sustainable or renewable resources in your business is&nbsp;another way of reducing your business' impact on the environment, and can save you money.</p>
<p>In today's business world, introducing sustainable practices into your business is perceived as a strength. For example, creating an energy efficient office and choosing more energy efficient business vehicles can help the environment, preserving resources for future generations. These practices also lead to reduced operating costs and improved services, saving money and improving your  business' reputation as being environmentally friendly.</p>
<p>Other emerging technology may support different areas of your  business, for example:</p>
<ul>
  <li>waste management and recycling</li>
  <li>manufacturing equipment</li>
  <li>materials and resources</li>
  <li>distribution and transport</li>
  <li>occupational health and safety</li>
  <li>improved public image and business goodwill</li>
  <li>increased efficiency.</li>
</ul>
