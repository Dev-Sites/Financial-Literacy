<h1>Costs and quantities</h1>
<p>As well as somewhere from which to operate, businesses require other resources. Some resources, such as equipment and machinery, can be costly.  </p>
<p>To minimise borrowings and the use of your own money:</p>
<ul>
  <li>at start up, get the resources your business can't do without</li>
  <li>gradually acquire additional resources as time goes on</li>
  <li>only purchase  resources you really <strong>cannot do without</strong>.</li>
  </ul>
<p>A rule of thumb concerning the purchase of expensive resources, such as equipment and machinery, should relate to the amount of usage it will get.  If it will only be used occasionally, it may be cheaper to hire. </p>
<p>If a resource will be used regularly, then prepare a list of suppliers to establish the best price available. </p>
<p>Once this is done, options for acquiring the item should be investigated. Some options to investigate are described below, but weigh up the pros and cons of each before committing to anything.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Leasing</strong> will mean you have regular  monthly commitments over a period of time. You don't own the equipment and, if you don't pay the monthly amount the  items will be taken away by the lessor. Although tax deductible, remember that entering into a lease increases your  financial commitment.  </li>
  <li><strong>Hire purchase</strong> is similar to leasing in  that you make monthly payments over a set period. The difference is that you will own the asset  outright at the end of the payment period. Interest and depreciation are tax deductible. As with leasing, this financing method  increases your monthly financial commitment.</li>
  <li><strong>Purchase outright </strong>is where the business  pays for the goods on the day or via an account. There may be savings through supplier discounts and no ongoing interest and repayments, but the business must have sufficient cash available.</li>
</ul>
<p>To help you decide you could look at which acquisition method is most affordable in terms of repayments.  This is particularly important in the early stages of running a business when cash flow may be tight.</p>
<p>Once the essentials are taken care of, additional resources can be acquired as the business becomes more established and cash flow improves. For example, to minimise initial outgoings, the owner of a cafe may purchase a second-hand bain-marie, pay for kitchen fit out and lease a cappuccino machine from a coffee supplier. As business improves, the cafe might lease a drinks fridge from a soft drink manufacturer and buy tables and comfortable seating for customer use.</p>
<h2>Resource  quantities</h2>
<p>If your business will involve handling and storing stock and/or raw materials, here are some further considerations.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Client demand</strong><br />
    If you are a wholesaler or manufacturer, you should estimate the amount of stock  you will need to meet your initial customer orders. You should also consider storage space.  </li>
  <li><strong>Display </strong><br />
    In the case of a retail operation, empty shelves do not project a positive image. You will need  to have sufficient stock (both  range and quantity) to attract  customers into your shop.  </li>
  <li><strong>Costs</strong><br />
  You may not have a credit rating that will allow you  to buy stock on credit (ie pay later). If this is the case, part of your financial resources must be reserved for  replacement stock until sufficient sales provide money for future purchases,  or your credit rating is established.
    <span>It can be possible to reduce costs by buying in bulk or by placing regular orders with a supplier.</span>    </li>
    </ul>
