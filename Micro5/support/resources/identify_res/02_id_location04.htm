<h1>Commercial premises</h1>
<p>If you decide to operate from any type of commercial premises, you need to decide on a location then think about everything else you need. This will mostly be determined by the type of business you will be operating.</p>
<h2>General points</h2>
<p>Here are some general points to consider when selecting a business premises. </p>
<ol>
  <li>Will the premises suit        future needs as well as  current ones?        </li>
  <li>Are improvements allowed?</li>
  <li>Is the council zoning applicable for the business you wish to commence? Note: always check with the local council to make       sure and also check if there are any other conditions placed on the site.</li>
  <li>Are there adequate  security devices, for example, deadlocked doors and alarm systems?</li>
</ol>

<h2><strong>Factory</strong>/warehouse</h2>
<p>Here are some points to consider if you want to operate from a factory or warehouse.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Power needs</strong><br />
    Do you need 3-phase power for heavy machinery? Are there sufficient power points or power capacity to run all your equipment safely?  </li>
  <li><strong>Office space/reception area </strong><br />
    Does the factory have a partitioned office area and/or waiting room for customers? An attractive office area will give a better impression of your business than just walking into a       factory. Is there space to do  your bookkeeping and to store business records?<br />
  </li>
  <li><strong>Amenities</strong><br /> 
    If you are employing staff, particularly where you will have both male and female employees, washroom facilities are necessary. When looking for a premise, look for separate male and female toilets and washrooms.  </li>
  <li><strong>Parking</strong> <br />
  What parking needs do you have for you, your staff and your customers? Off street parking is the best. If street parking must be used, are there restrictions on parking time or clearway times?<br />
  </li>
  <li><strong>Receiving/despatching</strong><br />
  Will you be receiving or despatching pallets or truckloads of goods? If so, access  to the loading area is crucial.  Is the loading area truck friendly? Is there a suitable sized roller door?<br />
  </li>
  <li><strong>Storage</strong><br />
    Is there  plenty of room for shelving?</li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>Retailing</strong></h2>
<ul>
  <li>Before  entering into a lease for any shop, observe the people traffic nearby, check the  number of competitors and obtain statistics about the potential customers for your business.  </li>
  <li>    Taking out  a lease in a shopping centre may have added costs. Fitting out a shop may be more expensive if it has to meet a standard approved by the centre management. Also, some shopping centres impose  advertising levies and/or demand a profit share.  </li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>Professional/office</strong></h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Location</strong> <br />
    Clients need to be able to get to the premises easily, so consider public transport and parking availability. Access by disabled persons should also be a primary consideration.<br />
    </li>
  <li><strong>Facilities</strong><br />
  Are there sufficient rooms, water, etc for the type of business you are  running?<br />
  </li>
  <li><strong>Presentation</strong><br />
    Do the premises project a professional image? Sometimes your ability in your particular field may be judged by the presentation of the business.</li>
  </ul>
