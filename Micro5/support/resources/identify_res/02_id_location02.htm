<h1>Home-based business</h1>
<p>Running a business from home can be a good option. Some factors to consider are discussed below.</p>
<h2>Council restrictions</h2>
<p>Check your local council for any restrictions about operating a business in residential areas.  </p>
<p>Some businesses may not be allowed to operate in residential areas at all, for example, motor mechanics and businesses that produce excessive noise or pollution.  </p>
<p>If your council does allow home businesses to operate, there may still be regulations and restrictions, for example, provision of car parking and whether or not customers are allowed on the premises.</p>

<h2>Access to your customers</h2>
<p>Do your customers need to be able to visit you, or do you go to their premises? </p>
<p>If you are retailing goods and need passing trade, a shop front is an obvious necessity. </p>
<p>If you are mobile and go to your customers, then a home based business may be a less costly way of starting your business.</p>

<h2>Are you renting?</h2>
<p>If you are renting, does your lease allow a business to operate from home?</p>
<p> Check your lease to see if it has a clause preventing this, or whether prior permission must be obtained from the landlord. </p>

<h2>Lifestyle</h2>
<p>Lifestyle choices may influence your decision. </p>
<p>Is there space available in your home so that you can separate your business from your home life? Otherwise, you may find that stock, business records, etc, begin to take over the whole house. </p>
<p>Will you be able to 'switch off' from your business when your business is at home? 
 Customers may ring or call at all hours, even if you advertise your hours of operation prominently.</p>
<p>Will you feel safe having clients in your home if you are home alone? 
 For example, a massage therapist decided not to operate her business from home as she felt she would be safer renting a room in a premise with other health practitioners.</p>

<h2>Occupational health and safety</h2>
<p>Keep in mind that having a safe workplace applies to a home business too. If you have clients coming to your home based business you will need to keep your home free of safety hazards and take out adequate insurance cover. Check out the relevant occupational health and safety requirements in your state or territory.</p>
<h2>Tax implications</h2>
<p>Some tax deductions may be available if your home is regarded as a place of business. Conversely, there may be capital gains tax implications to consider. You should consult taxation professionals for further advice.</p>
<h2>More information</h2>
