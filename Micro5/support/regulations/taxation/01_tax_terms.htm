<h1>Taxation terms</h1>
<p>Following is general information regarding some taxation terms. Taxation information is subject to change. Check the Australian Taxation Office at <a href="http://www.ato.gov.au" target="_blank" onclick="popUp(this.href, 'index');return false;" title="Australian Taxation Office">www.ato.gov.au</a> for current information.</p>
<h2><strong>Australian Business Number (ABN)</strong></h2>
<p>All businesses should have an Australian Business Number. This number is your `business identifier' when dealing with government departments such as the Australian Taxation Office and Customs. It must appear on your invoices and receipts.</p>
<p>If you do not state your ABN on invoices, a business you deal with must deduct 46.5% of the invoice value before paying you.  The balance will be sent to the Australian Taxation Office on your behalf and can be claimed at the end of the taxation year.</p>
<p>Application for an ABN using an approved
 form may be mailed to the Australian Taxation
 Office or lodged via the Business Entry Point web
 site at <a href="http://www.business.gov.au/" target="_blank" onclick="popUp(this.href, 'index');return false;" title="www.business.gov.au">www.business.gov.au</a> or via a tax agent.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Business Activity Statements (BAS)</strong></h2>
<p>You must account for all your sales and purchases on a Business Activity Statement (BAS) every quarter (there are monthly and limited annual options also available).</p>
<p>You may wish to engage the services of a book keeper.  Under new legislation they must meet Australian Taxation Office licencing requirements before being allowed to charge for assistance in preparing your Business Activity Statement.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Goods and  Services Tax</strong> (GST)</h2>
<p><span id="phContent">The Goods and Services Tax (GST) is a 10 per cent tax on the sale of most goods and services.</span></p>
<p>If your projected turnover for the year exceeds $75,000, you must register for GST. If it is below this figure then registration is optional.</p>
<p>Before deciding not to register for GST consider the following points:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Are your clients registered for GST?</li>
</ul>
<p>If the answer is yes then you need to consider if they will want to deal with you if you are not registered. If they want you to charge them GST and you want to continue dealing with them, then you should register for GST.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Are you making mainly GST free sales?</li>
</ul>
<p>If so then you may consider registration on the basis that, although your sales may be GST free, your purchases to run your business may not be.  If you are registered you will most likely receive refunds after lodging your business activity statement.</p>
<p>If you are registered for GST, then you must charge GST on all taxable sales and, except for sales under $82.50, (GST inclusive), provide your customer with a tax invoice.  If the sale amount is under $82.50 then you are only required to issue one on the customers request.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>PAYG withholding</strong></h2>
<p>If you have staff, or you are an employee of your own company, then you will be required to register for Pay as You Go Withholding.  This is done via the Australian Taxation Office.</p>
<p>It means that you must deduct the appropriate amount of income tax from the wages of your employees and send it to the Australian Taxation Office as part of your Business Activity Statement reporting.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Superannuation</h2>
<p>In most instances, you will be required to pay superannuation on behalf of your employees where their gross monthly wage is $450 or above.</p>
<p>This has to be paid into the fund of your employees choice within 28 days after the end of the quarter eg Payments for the June quarter have to be paid to your employee's fund by the 28th of July.</p>
<p>If you do not have employees and run your business as a sole trader or as a partnership, then you do not have to pay superannuation for yourself.</p>
