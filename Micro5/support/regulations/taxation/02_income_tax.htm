<h1>Your tax</h1>
<p>If your business is profitable in the first year, chances are you will have to pay tax on these profits as they will be considered income.  Your income tax payable is based on the total of your income from all sources.</p>
<p>It may be advisable to put some money aside towards the payment of your first year's tax.</p>
<p>After you have lodged your first income tax after starting business, the Australian Taxation Office will advise you as to whether or not you must make quarterly contributions towards your next tax bill.  This is called Pay As You Go.</p>
<p>If you are registered for GST or have Pay As You Go withholding obligations as an employer, these will be paid for as part of your quarterly Business Activity Statement.</p>
<h2><strong>INCOME TAX RETURNS</strong></h2>
<p>All individuals and companies that operate a business are required to lodge an annual income tax return. </p>
<p>Although these returns can be quite detailed, smaller businesses may be able to prepare their own, provided that are sufficiently confident in doing so. </p>
<p>Most businesses however, engage the services of a registered tax agent.  These professionals are generally accountants or solicitors and are the only people permitted by law to charge for the preparation of income tax returns. </p>
<p>If you are unsure, ask the person you are considering using whether they are registered with the Tax Agents Board for the preparation of tax returns.</p>
<p>You can also go to the tax agents board website <a href="http://www.tabd.gov.au/" target="_blank" onclick="popUp(this.href, 'index');return false;" title="www.tabd.gov.au">www.tabd.gov.au</a> to check to see if they are registered.</p>
<p>Even if you engage a registered tax agent to prepare your income tax return you are ultimately responsible for its contents. You are required to sign a declaration on the return, before lodgement, certifying that the content is true and correct. </p>
<p>Heavy penalties apply for providing false or misleading information on the return.  It may involve a court appearance or other penalties. </p>
<p>You will also be required to pay any taxes that is due to errors on the return.</p>
<p>In order to make preparing your tax return as simple as possible, set aside some time each week to keep your book work up to date.</p>
<p>The benefits of this are twofold,  </p>
<ul>
  <li>you       will be able to get a snap shot of how your business is actually       performing</li>
  <li>it       will cut the cost of accounting services as your book keeper/ accountant       will need to spend less time preparing information to go into the relevant       returns and statements.</li>
  </ul>
