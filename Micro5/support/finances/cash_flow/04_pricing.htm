<h1>Pricing</h1>
<p>What price should you sell your goods and services for? There are a number of factors that influence the price you charge. These include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>your costs</li>
  <li>your target market</li>
  <li>your objectives</li>
  <li>your marketing strategy and marketing mix</li>
  <li>competitors' prices</li>
  <li>the level of demand for the goods and/or services</li>
  <li>market conditions and trends.</li>
  </ul>
  <div class="clear">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The right price is often influenced by a combination of these factors and you should only establish<br />
 your price after carefully considering all influencing factors.</p>
<p>The price you charge for the goods and/or services you provide must be sufficient to cover all expenses and allow for a profit to be earned. A number of price-setting methods are available. </p>
<h2>Mark-up on cost</h2>
<p>Some businesses, particularly retail businesses, apply a set mark-up to the cost of an item to determine the selling price.<br />
 </p>
<p><strong>Example</strong><br />
 A fashion retailer applies a mark-up of 100% on all dresses and 50% on all jumpers.<br />
 </p>
<p>If the retailer pays a cost price of $80.00 for a dress, the selling price will be.<br />
 $80.00 + ($80.00 x 100%) = $160.00</p>
<p>If the retailer pays a cost price of $50.00 for a jumper, the selling price will be:<br />
 $50.00 + ($50.00 x 50%) = $75.00</p>
<h2>Recommended retail price (RRP)</h2>
<p>A recommended retail price is a selling price suggested by the wholesaler or the manufacturer. The<br />
 retailer, in most cases, can then decide whether to adopt the recommended price or not. Many retailers use the recommended retail price as a basis for setting their prices, even if they don't charge the recommended retail price. They do this by charging a constant amount below or above the RRP.</p>
<p><strong>Example</strong><br />
 A milk bar proprietor decides to sell all soft drinks at 10% below RRP, milk drinks at RRP and all blocks of chocolate at 5% above RRP.</p>
<h2>Market will bear</h2>
<p>In many industries, the price charged for a product or service will very much depend upon what the 
 market is prepared to pay. This may vary over time.</p>
<p><strong>Example</strong></p>
<p>When colour televisions were introduced to Australia in the mid 1970s, they retailed for
 over $1,000. This was because the number of colour televisions available in Australia at this time could be sold for this amount. Over time, the price has come down as the market was no longer prepared to pay this price.</p>
<h2>Break-even analysis</h2>
<p>Break-even analysis can be used as a method of price-setting. However, regardless of the method used to set your prices, break-even analysis should be used to ensure that your price is sufficient to cover all costs and provide a profit.</p>
<p><strong>Example</strong></p>
<p>Sarah intends to establish a business painting portraits and is planning to charge $125 per portrait.</p>
<p>Her sales related expenses, per portrait are $75 comprising:</p>
<ul>
  <li>canvas $30</li>
  <li>brushes $22</li>
  <li>paints $23.</li>
  </ul>
  <div class="clear">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Contribution margin (gross profit) = Price per portrait ($125) less sales related expenses ($75).</p>
<p>This means there is $50 available per portrait to cover operating expenses.</p>
<p>Sarah's monthly operating expenses come to a total of $1000 comprising:</p>
<ul>
  <li>rent for studio $500</li>
  <li>administrative expenses $330</li>
  <li>other overheads $170.</li>
  </ul>
  <div class="clear">&nbsp;</div>
<p>'Break-even' point = Operating expenses ($1000) divided by the contribution margin ($50). </p>
<p>This means that Sarah needs to paint 20 portraits per month just to cover her operating costs. If she sells more, she will make a profit. If she sells less, she will make a loss.</p>
<p>If Sarah cannot realistically paint 20 portraits in a month, then she either needs to increase her price per portrait to cover her costs, or, find ways to decrease costs.</p>
