<h1>Finance questions</h1>
<p>If you need extra finance, here are some things to consider before approaching any lender.</p>
<h2>How much?</h2>
<p>The amount you need includes the establishment costs plus initial working capital required, less your own funds available.</p>
<p><strong>Points to note</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>There is a fine line between borrowing too little or too  much. Borrowing more than you need will add to your costs. </li>
  <li>Once you take out one loan, it may make it more difficult to take out another while the original one still exists.</li>
</ul>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2>What is the money for?</h2>
<p>All money lenders will ask this question.  In many cases, loans will only be made available for specific purposes. Clearly state your purposes. The purpose may be specified in the contract and using the money for other purposes may be a breach of your contract.</p>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2>What type of loan?</h2>
<p>The best of way of finding out what you need is to investigate what various lending institutions have to offer. Some examples of lending products are described below.</p>
<p><strong>Business loans</strong> are available to business owners. Loan period is generally up to 10 years and limitations may apply on amount borrowed. Security over personal assets may be required. Interest rates may be fixed or variable.</p>
<p><strong>Overdrafts </strong>are generally short term loans, generally for covering times when there is a high cash outflow. An overdraft is a line of credit that allows you to overdraw or spend more money than you have in the bank up to an agreed limit.</p>
<p><strong>Mortgage for business premises</strong> is similar to a housing loan, but generally over a shorter period of time. Like a housing loan, it requires security over the property. Interest rate may be fixed or variable. </p>
<p><strong>Home equity loans are</strong> increasingly promoted by banks. These loans mean that you use the equity in your home (the difference between the house's value and what you owe) to finance a business. As the bank usually has a mortgage on the property, approval is usually granted more quickly than for a new loan. However, your mortgage amount, repayments and term of the loan generally increase. Your equity in the property decreases. </p>
<p><strong>Hire purchase</strong> is often associated with the purchase of cars or other machinery. Basically it means you have the use of the goods on hire whilst you pay them off. For assets such as cars, interest can be competitive with bank loans. </p>
<p><strong>Leasing</strong> is popular, particularly for cars. A lease is basically a hire or rental scheme that allows the use of an asset in exchange for a monthly payment.  Some leases have large balloon payments at the end of the period. This keeps repayments down, but a large bill (balloon payment) may have to be paid at the end of the lease. Some leases also include continuing maintenance clauses which may mean that the lessor (the owner) is responsible for maintenance. This could reduce your operating costs.</p>
<p><strong>Rental</strong> is becoming increasingly popular for items such as computers.  Many have fixed four year terms and the repayments can mean you pay at least double the cash price over the period of the rental.</p>
<p><strong>Credit card</strong> is a well established line of credit. Shop around for cards with good interest rates and features such as no penalties for early payment and interest free periods. <br />
 </p>
<p>Professionals such as solicitors or accountants may be able to assist you in obtaining finance.</p>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2>What time period?</h2>
<p>The term of the loan depends on the type of loan and the amount borrowed. Generally the longer the loan, the more interest you pay. The trade off is that repayments will be slightly lower.</p>
<p>Some loans have limited periods for repayments; others, such as credit cards, are open-ended.</p>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2>How much can I       afford in repayments?</h2>
<p>You will be able to judge this from your cash flow budget.</p>
<p>Many financial institutions have calculators on their websites that you can use to get an idea of what the repayments would be for a particular loan amount. </p>
