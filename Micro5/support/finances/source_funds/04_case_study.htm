<h1>The Paper Cup Company case study</h1>
<p> The Paper Cup Company owner, John Haddad, has built a business from a solo operation in 2004 to an enterprise now employing in excess of 15 staff members. John's rise in the small business world began when he was introduced to the National Enterprise Incentive Scheme (NEIS) – the government initiative designed to help eligible unemployed people start and run their new, viable small business. Kangan Batman TAFE currently delivers the NEIS program in Melbourne's inner, western and north-western suburbs.</p>
<p><img src="images/image_1.jpg" alt="John Haddad" width="350" height="268" /></p>
<p>John says, &quot;Up until then, I had been looking into the possibility of establishing a business which just imported paper cups from overseas. After some background research, I discovered that the costs involved in shipping and storing the cups made the venture unrealistic, so shifted focus and explored the possibility of producing the product here in Melbourne. The NEIS program was instrumental in helping me develop a business plan in those early days.&quot;</p>
<p>John is quick to point out that it hasn't all been smooth sailing over the past four years. &quot;The story of The Paper Cup Company so far has taught me that you can never be too prepared for surprises. At the beginning, I purchased a dud machine and it was a costly mistake. It felt like I had made one step forward in business and then two steps back,&quot; he says. &quot;Many others would possibly have cut their losses at that stage, but I contacted an old friend to explore the possibility of a partnership, and we purchased three more machines and moved into new premises.&quot;</p>
<p>At that stage, all the printing took place off-site. With the assistance of an overseas investor, John quickly realised that while the business was growing in clientele and output, profits were being severely dented by the off-site printing process. He was able to finance the purchase of a printer by re-investing a substantial amount in the business.</p>
<p>The continual growth of the business has brought with it a need to diversify. John has increased profitability by branching out into the production of paper cup machines for export around the world. With a team of engineers and his own expert knowledge of the industry, John has been able to improve on the previous design of the cup-making machines by increasing output levels and improving maintenance issues.</p>
<p><img src="images/image_2.jpg" alt="John Haddad's investments" width="350" height="268" /></p>
<p>Research and development have proved extremely important to the business. John estimates he has spent in excess of $2.5 million on research and development alone, recognising the need to control growth at a realistic rate while increasing his market share. John says, &quot;When you grow so quickly, there's always the need for cash-flow support, so government support for small businesses is so important – there are always challenges to face.&quot;</p>
<p>With a move to centralise operations and retain strong quality control over his product, John's next business move will involve relocating to larger premises and looking at the possibility of sourcing locally-milled paper. Currently, that's the only part of the process which can't be created in-house, but with John's aim of creating an entirely local product, he's hopeful the future will bring an opportunity to bring paper production into the bigger picture.</p>
<p>Despite some of the obstacles along the way, John credits the success of his business to persisting during times when many other business operators would have just walked away. &quot;This is a multi-billion dollar industry – we've grown from a $70,000 business in 2004 to a $1.5million business – so I always knew the market was there,&quot; he says. &quot;Obviously there's a point when it's important to realise your business dream may not work, but my long-term vision and being able to 'see the light at the end of the tunnel' has helped me persevere.&quot;</p>
