<h1>Projected changes in Australia</h1>
<p>There are factors outside the control of a business owner in the business environment (sometimes referred to as the marketing environment) that impact on the small business sector. These factors include future:</p>
<ul>
  <li>population changes (commonly referred to as  demographic issues)</li>
  <li>economic activity for the upcoming planning  period (which could be two or more years) </li>
  <li>labour force issues.</li>
  </ul>
<p>Following are observations of factors current at the time of writing. Up-to-date information can be accessed from various sources, such as the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) and Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) websites.</p>
<h2>Demographic issues</h2>
<p>The Australian population is ageing and is very much like an established European country such as Italy. The average age of an Australian is now 37 years (August 2006, Australian Bureau of Statistics census).  The projection is that this will increase over the next few years, but perhaps at a slower rate due to a recent mini baby boom that began at the turn of the century.  </p>
<p>The level of multiculturalism is projected to remain steady, with close to 30% of the population being born outside Australia or having one parent born outside Australia.  </p>
<p>The number of marriages in Australia has remained steady over the past 10 years in a band of 100,000 to 111,000 per annum.  </p>
<p>Melbourne is presently the fastest growing capital city in Australia and is forecast to rival Sydney in size (in approximately 20 years) if current trends remain.  It would be useful for a potential business owner to consider parts of Melbourne, Brisbane and the Gold Coast.</p>
<h2>Economic activity</h2>
<p>Economic activity in Australia has been very positive over the last 10 years. Australia is considered a first world economy (that is, part of the 20 plus OECD group of nations). Australia has been one of the better performing nations in this group over the last 10 years.</p>
<p>Australian economic growth has been between 3% to 5% per year over the last 10 years due to a number of factors.  Australia is seen as a stable political nation and attracts solid foreign investment.  The minerals and resources boom and the needs of China (and other manufacturing nations such as Japan, Korea and others) has led to Australia having very good economic growth statistics. Internal interest rates have been at record lows, inflation has been kept under control, retail spending has been strong and unemployment has decreased to less than 5%.</p>
<p>At the present time, the Australian economy is beginning to slow due to increases in interest rates by two percentage points over the last two years, as well as rising inflation and lower consumer sentiment.  The outlook is that the economy will pick up late in 2008 or early in 2009.  </p>
<p>Understanding that the economy is relatively unpredictable and susceptible to change is important for small business.  </p>

<h2>Labour force</h2>
<p>The Australian labour force is very dynamic and on the global stage considered highly skilled.  In Australia, there are presently skill shortages and in some industries (or professions) these are considered to be very serious, for example, medical doctors prepared to consult and practise in rural and regional Australia.</p>
<p>The ability to find appropriate labour (either as employees or contractors/sub-contractors) for a business is in many instances crucial to future growth.  Being able to find and retain the appropriate people will assist a business to meet its objectives.</p>
<p>For micro businesses (less than $200,000 in sales) and small businesses (less than $5 million in sales) deciding on the appropriate style of labour, that is whether to use employees or contractors/sub-contractors, is important.  There are positives and negatives about both styles of labour. Having employees (whether full-time or otherwise) has difficult obligations for a micro and small business, for example, superannuation charges, Work Cover obligations and other administration costs.  Using contractors/sub-contractors allows the business owner flexibility and less cost outlay if services are not needed full-time.</p>
