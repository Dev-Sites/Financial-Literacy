<h1>Environmental factors</h1>
<h2>This case study examines some factors that affect a city cafe.</h2>
<p>New operators have just set up a licensed cafe in the central business district (CBD).  Their business is going to operate in an environment where there are a lot of forces outside their control, but they must be aware of the positive or negative impact these forces can have on their business. </p>
<p>Some of the environmental concerns and their likely impact on this business are described below.</p>

<h2>Demographics</h2>
<p>Who is the business trying to target or attract?  For example, young office workers; young singles; sports minded young men and women, etc. Will there be enough of these customers in the CBD area to justify the investment in retail shop fit-out needs and other ongoing maintenance that the business will require?  </p>
<p><strong>This is probably a positive force for this business due to broad demographics in the CBD.</strong></p>
<h2>Economics</h2>
<p>At the time of writing (mid-2008), the Australian economy is slowing and there are signs that retail spending is beginning to decrease; interest rates for mortgage repayments are increasing and will potentially increase further; unemployment is low (under 5%) and looks like remaining low; new home building is falling; petrol prices (and other fuels) are rising.</p>
<p><strong>This is probably a negative force for this business at this time.</strong></p>
<h2>Cultural  and social</h2>
<p>If the business is targeting young semi-professionals and young professionals who work or visit the CBD regularly, the business must be in tune with cultural and social issues of interest to this broad target customer base.  Accepting a range of cultures and offering foods on the menu from various cultures could prove to be very popular, for example, Spanish, Middle Eastern and Latin American.  Being conscious of low fat  and energy rich foods could also be popular for this style of customer base. Socially, offering club nights for regular members or special treats for regular customers that are of interest to people under 30 could prove to be a popular business idea.  </p>
<p><strong>This is probably a positive force for this business.</strong></p>
<h2>Ethical  issues</h2>
<p>These issues include responsible serving of alcohol and designated social areas for smokers.  There could also be other ethical issues with operating a CBD licensed cafe, particularly if it were promoted that there are halal or kosher foods available for patrons.  These foods should be bought from legitimate and ethical suppliers to respect customers who may choose to buy these foods.  Finally, if the business were to donate a percentage of profits to a conservation/green organisation, this could prove to be popular. Ethically the business would have to live up to its promise.</p>
<p><strong>This is probably a positive force for this business.</strong></p>
<h2>Political  and legislative issues</h2>
<p>A cafe that has a liquor licence must comply with state and local government food handling and liquor regulations. There may be other permits and regulations required, such as a permit for an A frame on the footpath (to promote or advertise the business) and/or the seating of patrons on the footpath.  There may be other legal issues that the business must be aware of and these would vary from location to location.</p>
<p><strong>This is probably a positive force for this business (assuming they comply).</strong></p>
<h2><strong>Technological  issues</strong></h2>
<p>Technology is moving quite quickly for the hospitality industry and can assist with reducing customer waiting time and improving quality.  In many venues, food and drink orders are entered electronically and bookings can be made over the internet.  Technology can also be useful for business forecasting and monitoring costs.  </p>
<p><strong> This is probably a positive force for this business.</strong></p>
<h2>Pressure  group issues</h2>
<p>Being aware of current affairs and ensuring that the business does not become a target of unwanted pressure group publicity is important.  For example, if the business were to offer whale meat or employ staff on unfair conditions, the business could suffer from bad publicity. This could have a negative impact on business activity. </p>
<p><strong>This is probably a positive force for this business (assuming they do not offend any pressure groups).</strong></p>
<h2>The  physical environment</h2>
<p>With the Australian environment becoming hotter and less prone to consistent rainfall, what impact could the weather have on this business?</p>
<p><strong>This is probably a positive force for this business as they would have measures in place to cater for customer comfort and take advantage of favourable weather conditions, for example air-conditioning and outdoor seating.</strong></p>
