<h1>Ripple Products case study</h1>

 
  <p>Ripple Products is an innovative Australian design business specialising in products that align themselves with educational and environmental messages. The range of products available from Ripple Products includes various styles of Digital Shower Timers, Sand Timers, Water-saving Buckets and Enviro-tips. The business is based in Melbourne, Australia with distribution through Hong Kong and in the United Kingdom.</p>
  <p>Starting from personal savings and an insurance pay out when managing director, Tracy Bialek's car flooded, the first range of the innovative Shower Timer was launched in 2003. With Tracy's passion for the environment and experience in marketing and business, Ripple Products developed a niche product in the growing environment sector. In the last four years Ripple Products has expanded from a home based business into a four-person operation.</p>
  <p>Striving to be smart in targeting the growing range to various segments of the market, Ripple Products can be found online, in national retail outlets including Holysheet! and The Shaver Shop, green stores and museums. The range is also utilised on key campaigns like World Environment Day, Water Week and Earth Hour by environment agencies, government bodies and energy companies including the Australian Conservation Foundation, Sustainability Victoria and Energy Australia.</p>
