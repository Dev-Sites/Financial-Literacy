<h1><strong>Business types and structures</strong></h1>
<p>When starting out in business, one of your first decisions is to choose an appropriate business structure. Your choice of structure will depend on the type of business, the financial risk to you and the amount of money you have available for setting up the business.</p>
<p>The most common types of business structures are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>sole trader</li>
  <li>partnership</li>
  <li>company.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sometimes, the business structure you choose will depend on the type of business you wish to establish.</p>
<p><strong>Service business</strong>: In these businesses, the skills of the owner are most important.  Examples include hairdressing, alternative medicine, secretarial or bookkeeping services, lawn mowing and dog grooming. Low cost, low risk (both physical and financial) businesses such as these can use the most basic types of business structure – either sole trader or partnership.</p>
<p><strong>Trade:</strong> These businesses usually require a business operator to be licensed, eg a plumber or an electrician. Turnover and risk should be taken into account. In small businesses, sole trader or partnership may be the most economical way to start. If there is a risk of structural failure or damage due to unforeseen circumstances, then a limited liability company should be considered. </p>
<p><strong>Professional:</strong> These businesses generally involve people in fields such as medicine, accounting, law or finance. One of this group's concerns is the risk of being sued for professional negligence. In most (if not all) cases, professional indemnity insurance will provide some protection. Depending on the profession, there is the possibility of incorporating as a company to protect personal assets.</p>
<p><strong>Manufacturer/wholesaler</strong>: These businesses make and/or sell products. If goods are dangerous when misused, legal protection of the business owners is best served if a limited liability company is set up. If in any doubt, speak with an accountant or solicitor. </p>
<h2>Sole trader</h2>
<p>This is a business run by one person, although you may employ staff or engage contractors.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Except for registering a business name (optional), no  initial costs associated with starting up a business.</li>
  <li>Owner has full control over the operation of the  business.</li>
  <li>Easy to sell (depending on type of business) or close  down the business.</li>
  <li>Low ongoing administration requirements and costs.</li>
  <li>As income from business and other sources is combined  in assessing taxation liability, you also benefit from the tax free threshold  of $6000.</li>
  <li>No superannuation or insurance obligations for  yourself, keeping costs down.</li>
  </ul>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Wholly responsible for any debts incurred by the  business.</li>
  <li>No separate legal status for the business; any legal  action against your business is taken against you personally.</li>
  <li>May be difficult to sell if it carries your name in  its business name; this is particularly important where the business is built  up through your reputation. </li>
  <li>Income from all sources is totalled for tax assessment  purposes.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Example</strong></p>
<p>Julie has just been made redundant as a personal assistant in a large company. She has decided to set up a business at home doing secretarial work. She has all the necessary equipment to start immediately. As Julie is involved in providing her client with a presentable version of the work written by her clients, she would not need the added expense of forming a company. She can operate as a sole trader with a minimum of risk.</p>

<h2>Partnership</h2>
<p>In business terms, a partnership is the bringing together of individuals, companies or a combination of both for the operation of a business. In a small business, it relates mainly to individuals bringing their skills and/or capital together to set up a business.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Low cost in setting  up.</li>
  <li>Cheap to administer.</li>
  <li>Normally low costs in  dissolving the partnership.</li>
  <li>Shared responsibility,  taking the responsibility of operating the business out of the hands of one person.</li>
  <li>Considerable income  tax benefits in a family partnership, provided each partner can demonstrate  some input into the business.</li>
  <li>No superannuation or  insurance obligations for the partners, keeping costs down.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>All partners fully  responsible for debts of the partnership, not just their share.</li>
  <li>Decision making can  be slower unless all partners agree.</li>
  <li>Dispute resolution  could be involved and costly, particularly if there is no Partnership  Agreement. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Example</strong></p>
<p>Joe and Rita set up a concreting business. Joe does the concreting and Rita takes bookings and keeps the financial records. As both are active in the business, they can consider themselves a partnership for tax purposes.</p>
<p><strong>Before forming a business partnership</strong></p>
<p>The idea of forming a business partnership with friends may seem a good idea at the time, but it could have long-term negative consequences. To avoid potential problems, there are some key points to consider before formally entering a partnership.</p>
<p>It is essential for all partners to be aware of their legal obligations and exposure to debt if the business fails. It may also be worth checking the background of your potential partner or partners to ensure that they actually have the skills they say they have. And the following attributes are significant in the success of any business.</p>
<p><strong>Commitment:</strong> All partners should have a strong commitment to the business. They should be clearly focused on the achievement of real results and their attendance and duties should be clearly set out. There is no room for a business partner who often turns up late, disappears early or takes days off. This unprofessional approach can cause friction, as the other partner or partners will have to work harder to keep the business viable. </p>
<p><strong>Willingness to learn and adapt:</strong> All partners should have a basic knowledge of all aspects of the business. Barriers such as physical impairment or lack of qualifications may stop some partners performing all facets of the business. However, everyone should be able to learn the bookkeeping system, banking procedures and cleaning operations.</p>
<p>Skills development, such as learning to use new software or machinery, must be the responsibility of all partners. Being open to changes in technology and business practices is also important. This should include a willingness to adopt these changes and seek outside assistance when necessary.</p>
<p><strong>Communication:</strong> All partners should communicate regularly to keep up to date on current operations and future plans. Formal meetings that allow full and honest discussion must be held regularly. These meetings should focus on developing action plans with people taking responsibility for each action.</p>
<p><strong>Minimising the risk</strong></p>
<p>There should be a clear agreement on each person's position and responsibilities in a partnership. A formal Partnership Agreement should set out each partner's obligations in working towards the goals of the business.</p>
<p><strong>Equity:</strong> Equity should not be based only on money invested. Contributions of time and expertise should be recognised, based on hourly rates and/or results, and should take into account the cost of replacing these skills. The Partnership Agreement should clearly state that lack of input will result in reduced returns for non-contributing partners.</p>
<p><strong>Exit strategy</strong>: The Partnership Agreement should include an exit strategy, with a formula for the distribution of proceeds based on input by the partners. This will state clearly to non-contributing partners that there is a penalty for non-performance. </p>
<p><strong>If problems persist</strong></p>
<p>Raise and try to resolve any issues immediately, before things get worse. If efforts to improve things fail, dissolving of the partnership may be the best option, but might not be straightforward due to financial commitments or settlement difficulties. A Partnership Agreement, in particular exit strategy clauses, will make dissolution easier. </p>
<p><strong>Dissolution</strong></p>
<p>If dissolution cannot occur by mutual agreement, give three months' notice of your intention to dissolve the partnership. Seek legal advice if you are unsure of your rights regarding intellectual property, ownership of equipment, lease and other commitment liabilities, distribution of asset sale proceeds and distribution of future income generated by the business. </p>
<h2>Company</h2>
<p>A company is an independent legal entity that can do business in its own name. There is only one director required. The company's powers are set out in its Memorandum and day to day running is covered by its Articles of Association, which are essentially the rules of the business.  In practice, the Australian Securities and Investment Commission has model rules that are used by default if you do not create your own.</p>
<p>When you set up a company, you have higher establishment costs and more legislation to deal with. Most small businesses incorporate as proprietary limited companies. This has limitations on shareholding (shares are not publicly tradable on the Australian Stock Exchange) and means that only the assets of the company are available if the business is sued.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Limited liability – except  in limited circumstances, personal assets are not at risk if the company fails.  The company will be sued for debts in its own right and the amount of money  available to creditors will be limited to the value of its assets, including  equipment.</li>
  <li>Easier to sell the  business as it can continue in its own right.</li>
  <li>Some businesses  prefer to deal with companies only.</li>
  <li>May present a more  professional image.</li>
  <li>Flat rate of income  tax.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>High starting costs, including  company registration, purchasing a company seal and bank fees to set up a  company bank account.</li>
  <li>Ongoing fees such as  annual reports to the Australian Securities and Investment Commission (currently  $212 payable on the anniversary of the company being set up).</li>
  <li>Higher standard of  overall record keeping/accountability, eg decisions on asset purchases must be  recorded as resolutions in minutes of meetings, even if you are the sole  director.</li>
  <li>Directors are  required to act in the best interests of the company, not themselves. This may  cause some conflict with your priorities. The loaning of company money to  directors may come under scrutiny from the Australian Tax Office.</li>
  <li>You may be an  employee of your business. If this is the case, Pay as You Go (Withholding),  superannuation contributions and WorkCover obligations will increase  administration and costs of operation.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Example</strong></p>
<p>Ramon is establishing a hairdressing supply business that involves the production and sale of lotions. By setting up a company, he protects his personal assets from being part of any claim against him. If a client has a bad reaction to one of the products, the action will be taken against the company.</p>
